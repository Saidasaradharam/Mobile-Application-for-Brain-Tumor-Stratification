        A cancerous brain tumor, also known as a malignant brain tumor, is a fast-growing and aggressive abnormal growth of cells
        in the brain. Cancerous brain tumors can spread to other parts of the brain and the body, making them much more dangerous
        than non-cancerous tumors. Symptoms of cancerous brain tumors can include headaches, seizures, personality changes, weakness,
        and vision or hearing problems. Treatment options for cancerous brain tumors include surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy,
        targeted therapy, and immunotherapy, depending on the tumor\'s location, size, and type. The prognosis for cancerous brain
        tumors can vary depending on many factors, including the type and stage of the tumor, the person's age and overall health,
        and the treatment received. Gliomas are tumors that arise from the glial cells of the brain and can be highly malignant
        and aggressive. Meningiomas, on the other hand, are tumors that arise from the meninges, the layers of tissue that cover
        the brain and spinal cord. </string>
